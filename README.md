## Features of Jarvis:  
- 👀 The main Theme of jarvis is to give responsive Answers at any Situations. It can give answer to any questions prompted by the user searches. It was primarily built for voice based interactions but due to users comfort also added Input box to type an input also added an files selector helps to select your file and process to summarize the given file via google ai. And for real world data like sports updates, Latest News Headlines, Recipies, Weather teller with vast range Plays prompted songs from youtube, Can do System controls like(set brightness to 30%) ,Interactive Responses also have an Local storage (json) it can remember the information like names, Important dates, Favourite foods, Etc and can be retrieved them when user asks for. By the way it can do this all with Just One command. Hey Jarvis.......
